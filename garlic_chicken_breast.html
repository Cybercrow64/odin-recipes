<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h4>For the chicken</h4>
<ul>
    <li>2-3 large boneless and skinless chicken breasts halved horizontally to make 4</li>
    <li>4 tbsp flour</li>
    <li>4 tbsp finely grated fresh Parmesab cheese</li>
    <li>2 tsp salt</li>
    <li> 1/2 tsp black cracked pepper</li>
    <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
</ul>

<h4>For the sauce</h4>
<ul>
    <li>5 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li> 2 tbsp butter</li>
    <li> 1 small onion finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 whole head of garlic</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cup chicken broth stock</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cup of heavy cream</li>
    <li>1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>2 tbsp fresh parsley, to serve</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Season the chicken with salt, garlic powder and pepper.</li>
    <li>In a shallow bowl, combine the flour, parmesan cheese. Dredge chicken in the flour mixture; shake off excess</li>
    <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Swirl pan to coat evenly.</li>
    <li>Fry 2-3 chicken breasts until golden on each side, cooked through and no longer pink (about 4-5 minutes each side, depending on the thickness of your chicken). Transfer to a warm plate. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Wipe pan over with a sheet of paper towel. Repeat with remaining oil, butter and chicken breasts. When cooked, transfer the chicken onto the same plate.</li>
    <li>Reduce heat to medium. Sauté the onion in the remaining oil/juices in the pan until softened.</li>
    <li>Smash 6 whole cloves of garlic with the blunt edge of the back of a knife</li>
    <li>Add the remaining oil to the pan and heat through, mixing it through the onions. Sauté smashed garlic cloves and whole garlic cloves until fragrant, about 2-3 minutes. Add the broth to deglaze the pan. Scrape up any browned bits and let simmer and reduce to half, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Reduce heat to medium-low. Pour in the cream. Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer for about 2-3 minutes, combining all of the flavours together</li>
    <li>Mix in the parmesan cheese. Continue cooking gently for about 2-3 minutes until cheese melts, while stirring occasionally. Season with salt and pepper to your taste</li>
    <li>Add the chicken back into the pan and let simmer for a further 2-3 minutes to thicken the sauce to your liking. The chicken breast will soak up all of the delicious flavours.</li>
    <li>Garnish with parsley and a little black cracked pepper.</li>
